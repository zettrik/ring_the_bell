# Bill Of Material

All electronic parts are easy to find in online shops (therefroe no links).

The wood was bought as a big board and cut in pieces with a handsaw.

Costs for the lights are high because of professional equipment (the cheapest)
with DMX. That way all components are also usable for other light
installations. You can save a lot of money building the lights yourself (see
DIY RGB LEDs below).

## Gamepads

These are the parts for one gamepad. The gamedesign is optimised for three
players. But you can easily connect more. The limiting factor will be the
number of wifi connections handled by the Pi. In case you're planning with some
dozens gamepads better use a separated wifi access point.
