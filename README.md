## Game Principle

### Rules Of "Climb The Ladder"

The goal of this game is to climb the ladder and ring the bell. But
you won't climb alone. You have to be fast as a team.

The "ladder" has ten random blinking lights. Every player has a gamepad with three
blinking buttons. They also change the color at random. In one moment a color will
settle on the ladder as one the gamepads. Press as fast as you can all buttons 
with same color. All of you have to do is hit the right button just in time to 
climb one step up.

If one of you ist too slow, the next round will start at the same level.
If one of you hits a wrong button, you fall one step down.

Start of the game will be easy and you will climp up quickly. As you raise level
your time will shorten. Also some unforseen things might happen at any time.

Will you reach the top and ring the bell?
